  2. Average Price Analysis:
      - YTD Average Price
      - MTD Average Price
      - YOY Growth in Average Price

### Functions Used ###
---
**1. Created a calendar table in DAX**: to ensure that all the calendar days are included from the start to the end, as the original dataset my not have data for each and every day. This will give the ability to perform different data operations, such as Year To Date (YTD), Year over Year (YOY), Month to Date (MTD)
   
                 Calendar Table = CALENDAR(MIN(car_data[Date],MAX(car_data[Date]))
  
**2. Time Intelligence Functions**: created new measures using TOTALMTD, SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR, TOTALYTD

                YTD Avg Price = TOTALYTD(AVERAGE(car_data[Price ($)]),'Calendar'[Date])

**3. Filter Functions**: ALLSELECTED

                 Max Point on Area Chart = IF(MAXX(ALLSELECTED('Calendar'[Week]),[Total Sales])=[Total Sales],MAXX(ALLSELECTED('Calendar'[Week]),[Total Sales]),BLANK())

### Results and Findings
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The company's sales have been steadily increasing over the past year, with a noticeable peak during the holiday season.
2. Product category A is the best-performing category in terms of sales and revenue. 

### Recomendations
